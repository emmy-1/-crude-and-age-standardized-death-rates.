# The exercise

Below is a table showing the age-specific death rates from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in both the United States and Uganda in 2019. The values are given as deaths per 100,000 people.

Your task is to write a Python script that calculates both the crude death rate and the age-standardized death rate for all ages in both the United States and Uganda for 2019.

Your answers should represent the whole population of each country, and the value should be given as deaths per 100,000 people, rounded to one decimal place. 

<aside>
üìù **At the beginning of your Python script, write a short paragraph (<300 words) describing your process as if you were reporting to your line manager.**

This should cover the steps you have taken, any assumptions you have made, and a brief description of the reasons for the differences between the different calculated death rates. 

Comments in the main body of your code that aid understanding of what the code is doing are *not* included in the 300 words.
