CASE STUDY : # CASE STUDY : CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE IN USA AND UGANDA

The crude death rate measures the proportion of the population that has died from a specific disease. It is calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population and then multiplying by a scale, such as 100,000 per person. For example, if the number of people who died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a population of 334319.671 is 2164.74, the crude death rate would be 647.5 deaths per 100,000 persons.

To solve the problem, I followed the following steps:

1. Imported COPD data for the United States and Uganda from a CSV file using the pandas library.
2. Cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns, correcting incorrect data, and renaming the columns for easier use.
3. Calculated the crude death rate for the United States and Uganda by adding the death rate for each country and dividing by the total population for each country, then multiplying by 100,000.

It is important to note that while the crude death rate is not inaccurate, it may offer a biased view of the issue as it does not account for factors such as age structure, sex, and demographics. Comparing the COPD death rates between Uganda and the United States may lead to the conclusion that something in the United States, such as nutrition, lifestyle, or healthcare, is causing more deaths from COPD than in Uganda.

As the risk of dying from COPD increases with age, the crude death rate for the United States may be higher than that of Uganda if the US population is older than that of Uganda, even if the risk of dying from COPD is the same in both countries.

To accurately compare the rates of a health outcome that becomes more frequent with age, age standardization must be applied to adjust the rates to a standard population. Age standardization is a method used to make fair comparisons between populations with different age distributions.

To apply age standardization, a standard population with a specific age structure is used as a reference. Researchers can then compare health outcomes between different locations within a country or between different countries.

To apply age standardization in my code, I followed these three steps:

1. Sourced the age WHO World Standard Population Distribution (%) from the standard population distribution CSV file.
2. Multiplied the age-specific death rate by the standard population distribution.
3. Summed the rates to obtain one number called the age-standardized rate.

Key Points:

One interesting phenomenon I observed was that the crude death rate in Uganda was higher than that of the United States. This may be due to limited access to healthcare, poor nutrition, and high rates of infectious diseases in Uganda. Even when the age-standardized death rate was calculated, the rate was still higher in Uganda than in the United States unless the patients were in their 50-59 and older than 85 years old.

Assumptions:

1. I assumed that the death rate and population estimation were reliable, complete, and consistent as these factors would affect the calculation and not reflect the true picture.
2. I assumed that the cause of death was accurately identified and recorded in both countries.

Thank you for your time, and I hope this report provides a clear and concise understanding of the steps taken to solve the problem and the methodologies used to calculate the crude death rate and age-standardized death rate for the United States and Uganda.

Sincerely, [Your Name]
